You better not be pressing O/B/RMB 3 times in Axe mode to use SAED.. here are all the ways to perform Amped Elemental Discharge (AED), or Super Amped Elemental Discharge (SAED) when your shield is charged.

TL;DR
<p style="font-size:14px;">
- You need some Guard to be able to GP AED/SAED all attacks
- Guard stacks with red shield and guard points
- Red shield and guard points are each equivalent to 2 points of Guard
- Guard skill caps at 5 but you DO still benefit from red shield and GP at Guard 5
- (you can be at "Total Guard 9" with Guard 5, red shield, GP)
- Total Guard 2, 4, 6, and 8 are the same as 1, 3, 5, 7 (Guard has breakpoints at odd numbers)
- Guard 1 is enough for about 4/5 of monsters
- Guard 3 is enough for basically every monster except Rajang
- Guard 5 is comfy as you can be equal to Guard 3 without using guard points
</p>

Q: Why use Guard on CB?
<p style="font-size:14px;">In sword mode, Charge Blade can counter with (S)AED after blocking an attack. Depending on the strength of the attack, when blocking your character will go into one of three recoil animations: small, medium, or large knockback. If you receive large knockback, you CANNOT counter and additionally you lose a large chunk of sharpness.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">There are three ways to reduce block recoil received by monster attacks and thus make it easier to counter attacks: increasing Guard skill, charging your shield, and blocking using guard points instead of holding the block button. As it turns out, even if you always use guard points and keep your shield charged there are many attacks that still deal large knockback, so in practice at least 1 Guard skill is recommended for general purpose builds.</p>
Q: How does Guard skill stack with charged shield and guard points?
<p style="font-size:14px;">An easy way to explain this is that charged shield and guard points are each equal to 2 points of Guard. However, adding these to your Guard skill your "total Guard" CAN exceed the max skill level of Guard which is 5. Contrary to what anyone may say you DO still benefit from charged shield and guard points when at Guard 5.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">Another important thing is that only odd numbers (and zero) matter when considering Guard. Having Guard 2 means you will receive the same knockback from all attacks as Guard 1. Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
Guard 0 = Guard 0
Guard 1 = Guard 1
Guard 1 + charged shield = Guard 3
Guard 0 + charged shield + GP = Guard 4 = Guard 3
Guard 1 + charged shield + GP = Guard 5
Guard 5 + charged shield + GP = Guard 9</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">It's important to note here that for example, if you receive medium knockback with Guard 1, it doesn't necessarily mean you will receive small knockback with Guard 3. Behind the scenes every monster attack has a "knockback power" (some number from 0 to 100) and your recoil received is a function of that number and your total guard power. So for example (using made up numbers) if you have total guard 5, monster attacks with knockback between 40 and 70 are medium knockback. If you have total guard 7, monster attacks with knockback between 60 and 90 are medium. You can see that an attack of 50 would be medium with guard 5 and small with guard 7, but an attack of 65 would be medium for both.</p>
Q: How much Guard do I need?
<p style="font-size:14px;">I don't have a comprehensive list of monsters and how much Guard you need to be able to GP all of their attacks with medium knockback. What I can say is 1 is enough for ~80% of monsters and 3 is enough for ~95% of monsters, IF you are GPing every attack (in vanilla world Guard 1 was enough for 99% of monsters). 5 is only required for a very small number of monsters (such as Rajang) but it is nice to have because Guard 5 regular block is equivalent to Guard 3 GP, so you can play a bit comfier and activate Offensive Guard with less effort. Guard 5 also can be attained with a single charm (Ironside Charm V).</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fIq0b1w.png"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mqdxKsM.png">

At certain points during some attacks, your character will have their shield facing forward in front of them. These points in the attack animation are called Guard Points and your character is considering to be blocking during them. For a full list of attacks with Guard Points and their timing, keep scrolling down.

<h4 id="gp-info-2" style="margin-top:-40px;padding-top:40px;"><a href="#gp-info-2">#</a> Why should I use Guard Points?</h4>
Blocking using Guard Points instead of regular blocking using R2/RT/Ctrl has several benefits.
<ol>
    <li>Reduced knockback when blocking (similar effect to Guard skill)</li>
    <li>If your shield is charged, blocking with a Guard Point creates a small explosion that deals a small amount of damage and some stun damage</li>
    <li>Guard Points can allow you to block earlier than pressing R2/RT/Ctrl to block (see below video)</li>

<h1 id="offensive-guard" style="margin-top:-40px;padding-top:40px;"><a href="#offensive-guard">#</a> Offensive Guard FAQ</h1>
Why use Offensive Guard on Charge Blade?
<p style="font-size:14px;">As a block and counter-based weapon, Offensive Guard is a strong option for Charge Blade once you have all your other core skills, giving 15% bonus attack at max level for a short time (~10 seconds). With Guard Points, Charge Blade has an easy way to access blocking by canceling out of ending lag of other attacks (something that Lance can also do but Gunlance cannot do). The bonus attack from Offensive Guard also increases your damage with Impact Phials by a substantial amount.</p>
How do you activate Offensive Guard?
<p style="font-size:14px;">You must block a monster's attack (other players and barrel bombs cannot trigger it), and the attack must be blocked within about 0.5 seconds of entering blocking state. This means that if you start holding block (or enter a guard point) and you are hit within 0.5 seconds it will trigger, and if you are hit after 0.5 seconds it will not trigger. There is another peculiarity with these rules which will be covered below.</p>
Sometimes I block within 0.5 seconds and Offensive Guard does not trigger
<p style="font-size:14px;">You may notice this happens when you are standing (not attacking) waiting for a monster to hit you, then you input BLOCK followed by ATTACK with the goal of doing an Axe morph guard point, then mysteriously OG does not trigger. The issue with this is that <b>Offensive Guard window ends when you enter a new blocking state</b>. If you held BLOCK for a brief moment before pressing ATTACK to perform the morph, your player will have transitioned from idle to regular block (when you pressed BLOCK), then regular block to guard point (when you pressed ATTACK). Because there were two blocking states, Offensive Guard was only eligible to be triggered during the first blocking state (when BLOCK was held down before pressing ATTACK).</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">What this means is if you want to trigger Offensive Guard from an Axe Morph from idle, you must perform a perfect input and not hold BLOCK briefly before the morph. If you have time, you can do a weak slash chained into Axe Morph, which works because even if you hold BLOCK before pressing ATTACK, you won't do a regular block as long as you input ATTACK before the ending lag of weak slash is over.</p>

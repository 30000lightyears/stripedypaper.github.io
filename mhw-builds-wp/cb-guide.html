<h4><a href="#section0-2" id="section0-2" class="offset-id">0.2</a> • Why this isn't a video? <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Most weapon guides are videos as many people find it easier to learn visually and see the weapon at work, but I specifically made this one a text guide for the following reasons:

<ul>
<li>Text guides can be updated or corrected easily</li>
<li>Compared to a video guide, it's easier to jump between sections or revisit a particular section</li>
<li>I didn't feel like recording my voice</li>
</ul>

While this is inspired by .txt gamefaqs guides of the past, I included video clips as I realize a text only guide would be too hard to follow.

<div class="spacer-big"></div>

<h1><a href="#section1-0" id="section1-0" class="offset-id">1.0</a> • Basics <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h1>

This part of the guide mostly covers the moveset and mechanics of Charge Blade. Countering from block reaction and guard points are included here as even though they are somewhat advanced techniques, they are essential to learn.

<h4><a href="#section1-2" id="section1-2" class="offset-id">1.2</a> • Sword Mode Basics <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

This is a small set of moves in sword mode that are useful to know before the following sections. Attacking in Sword mode will gradually build up phial energy in your Sword. As you build up more energy your phial gauge will change color from white, to yellow, to red.

</div>
</div></div>

If you attack too much in Sword mode without reloading, your sharpness gauge will glow red and all your Sword attacks will be deflected. Reloading with yellow or red phial outlines will refill some phials and reset your Sword phial energy buildup to zero.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">

</div>
</div></div>

Remember that you can prep your next reload by getting yellow/red phial outline even when you are full on phials. If you have full phials and red phial outlines, you can spend all your phials and then immediately reload without having to first attack in Sword mode.

It's helpful when starting out to memorize combos but take care not to get stuck only using them. For example, many people start to associate Amped Element Discharge with pressing △+O 3 times in a row because it's easy to memorize, but eventually you should learn that Amped Element Discharge follows Shield Thrust, which follows ANY Sword mode action including Reload.

<h4><a href="#section1-3" id="section1-3" class="offset-id">1.3</a> • Axe Mode Basics <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

This is a small set of moves in axe mode that are useful to know before the following sections.

I purposely omit most of the Axe moveset here as a large portion of the Axe moveset is only worth using under the effects of Savage Axe Slash <a href="#section1-11">[1.11]</a>.

Axe attacks that consume phials (and some other attacks) deal <b>phial explosion damage</b> in addition to the physical hit. This type of damage is exclusive to Charge Blade. Phial explosion damage does not consume sharpness and cannot crit. Since it involves talking about Charge Blade phial type, phial explosion damage won't be fully covered until <a href="#section2-1">[2.1]</a>.

<h4><a href="#section1-4" id="section1-4" class="offset-id">1.4</a> • Charging your shield <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Your shield will become charged when you use the attack Elemental Roundslash with phials loaded. From this section onward, Amped Element Discharge will be abbreviated as AED.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">

    <li>Charging your shield again when it is already charged will add to its duration, up to its cap of 180 seconds</li>
    </ul>
</div>

You should almost always prioritize keeping your shield charged.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section1-5" id="section1-5" class="offset-id">1.5</a> • Super Amped Element Discharge <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

When your shield is charged, Super Amped Element Discharge will replaced Amped Element Discharge. Super Amped Element Discharge will be abbreviated to SAED from now on.

<h4>Checkpoint</h4>
If you are new to CB, this is a good place to pause and try your first hunt or two with what you've been shown so far: basic Sword mode combos, reloading, charging your shield, and using SAED. Once you have the basic flow of the weapon down, everything after will be easy.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section1-5-1" id="section1-5-1" class="offset-id">1.5.1</a> • Cancelling SAED into AED <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

When your shield is charged, sometimes you may want to still use AED instead of SAED.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">

<div class="pfix">
Some situations for cancelling SAED into AED include:

<h4><a href="#section1-6" id="section1-6" class="offset-id">1.6</a> • Charging your sword <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Your sword will become charged when you use the attack Condensed Element Slash while your shield is charged.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">

Other info
<ul>
<li>Lasts 45 seconds</li>
<li>Also prevents all Sword attacks from bouncing</li>
<li>Does not use any phials and does not use any of your charged shield duration</li>
</ul>
</div>

Generally, you should not prioritize keeping your sword charged. Condensed Element Slash is not a fast attack and thus competes with AED/SAED (and Savage Axe Slash which will be covered later) in openings where you can use it, and AED/SAED will deal more damage.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section1-7" id="section1-7" class="offset-id">1.7</a> • Blocking <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

After blocking an attack, you gain a (very) small amount of phial energy. Remember that you can not only block physical attacks, but also roars, wind pressure, and tremors.

Charge Blade has unique options after successfully blocking an attack, most notably being able to AED/SAED directly after blocking an attack. Thus blocking is an offensive option (like it is for Lance).

</div></div>

You will be unable to counter after blocking if you receive large knockback from the attack. Increasing block strength can reduce knockback and allow you to counter those attacks <a href="#section2-2">[2.2]</a>.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">

Other info
<ul>
<li>Blocking an attack builds phial energy equal to a Weak Slash (3) for small or medium knockback, and triple that amount (9) for large knockback. For reference, a Charged Double Slash is 27 phial buildup across both hits.</li>
<li>Some attacks are unblockable, such as "laser" or "gas" type attacks and grabbing attacks. Using the armor skill Guard Up makes most of these attacks blockable but some attacks are never blockable even with Guard Up.</li>
<li>Guarding uses stamina and if your stamina would be reduced to 0 by blocking an attack, the attack will pierce your block. Some attacks are technically blockable but have such high stamina depletion that they are effectively unblockable (only example I can think of is Kulve Taroth's super ground punch.</li>
<li>During block recoil, your character is still considered to be blocking, so you don't have to do anything special to block multi-hit attacks.</li>
</ul>

A Guard Point is a special type of block. Certain charge blade attacks have the shield in front of your character for a short time during the attack's animation. If a monster attack hits you from the front during this period, you will block it as if you were holding the block button. Then you can combo into any of the options after blocking in the above section.

Due to the increased difficulty, blocking with guard points has several bonuses over blocking with holding R2:
<ul>
<li>Guard points create a phial explosion if your shield is charged</li>
<li>Block strength is increased, stacking with the increase from charged shield <a href="#section2-2">[2.2]</a></li>
<li>Holding the block button to block cannot interrupt the ending lag of attacks, but Morph to Axe can, meaning blocking using the Morph to Axe guard point is faster than blocking using the block button (see video below). In fighting game terms, Morph to Axe can take advantage of IASA frames but blocking with R2 cannot.</li>

<h4><a href="#section1-9" id="section1-9" class="offset-id">1.9</a> • Clutch Claw <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

New action in Iceborne. Unlike Hammer and Lance, Charge Blade has no special combos involving the clutch claw. It's only used for softening/tenderizing monster parts and flinch shots.

While grappled, your stamina drains quickly. Also unlike mounting, you are not invulnerable to the monster's attacks so it is risky to grapple to a monster that is active and attacking. The following sections will explain different ways to use the Clutch Claw (at the very least it is several free topples every hunt so don't skip figuring it out).

<h4><a href="#section1-9-1" id="section1-9-1" class="offset-id">1.9.1</a> • Clutch Claw Stagger <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

New to Iceborne, all monsters will occasionally flinch back and enter a distinctive drooling pose with their side exposed for about 5 seconds. This is called clutch claw stagger, clutch stagger, or "clagger" (slang). The reason it is called this is that grappling onto the monster while it is clutch staggered will extend the stagger (for about 5 more seconds) and guarantee you have enough time to flinch shot or tenderize the monster.

<h4><a href="#section1-9-2" id="section1-9-2" class="offset-id">1.9.2</a> • Tenderize Attack <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Charge Blade is classified as a heavy weapon so it will fully tenderize a monster part in one tenderize attack. Tenderized parts temporarily take additional physical damage from all hunters. Of note is that Charge Blade's tenderize attack leaves you in Axe mode so you will be unable to block right away.

While grappled to a monster's head, you can press R2 to launch the monster forward some distance. This is called a Flinch Shot. If the monster bumps into a wall during the Flinch Shot, they will topple and give you a long opening. Instead of using Flinch Shot right away, you can also press O to turn the monster 90 degrees so they are facing a wall, then Flinch Shot.

<li>What technically constitutes a "wall" is somewhat unreliable so don't be surprised if a monster slides along a wall without toppling</li>

<li>A non-enraged monster is guaranteed to enrage if it is Flinch shotted a total of 2 times while not enraged, even if these flinch shots did not result in topples</li>
<li>A non-enraged monster is guaranteed to enrage if its head is turned a total of 3 times using Claw Attack while not enraged</li>
<li>The above 2 conditions apply in addition to the normal conditions to enrage a monster which varies by monster. This means a monster may enrage after just 1 flinch shot if enough damage is dealt to it.</li>

<h4><a href="#section1-10" id="section1-10" class="offset-id">1.10</a> • Slinger Burst <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

New to Iceborne, pressing L2 after certain actions will perform a Slinger Burst if you have slinger ammo loaded. This consumes 1 ammo and fires a small volley of the ammo you had loaded. With certain ammo types, this burst will always cause a monster to flinch.

<h4><a href="#section1-11" id="section1-11" class="offset-id">1.11</a> • Savage Axe Slash <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

While under the effects of Power Axe mode, all Axe mode attacks become much stronger and most of the moveset is "unlocked" and worth using. In particular, AED and Morph to Axe after blocking/guard-pointing become strong counter options and looping Elemental Discharge II gives you the highest DPS Charge Blade can do (see next section).

However, you are disencentivized from using SAED because it will remove the buff immediately. Repeatedly re-applying Power Axe mode is undesirable because of the fact that the move requires a decent sized opening and Savage Axe Slash is not itself a strong attack (the second weakest Axe mode attack). In other words, you want to either use Savage Axe Slash once and keep it active as long as possible while not using SAED at all, or forego Savage Axe Slash entirely to focus on using SAED. More info about these two styles of play can be found <a href="/savage-axe-style-vs-saed-style/">here</a> (also linked in <a href="#sectionA-3">[A.3]</a>).

<h4><a href="#section1-11-1" id="section1-11-1" class="offset-id">1.11.1</a> • Axe Mode combos <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Why is this section all the way over here? Compared to Sword mode, Axe mode loses both mobility and the offensive and defensive options from blocking. It's not worth staying in Axe mode for more than 1 or 2 attacks, unless of course your attacks are massively buffed by Power Axe mode. This section will list useful <b>Axe Mode combos to use when you have Power Axe mode</b>.

Your bread and butter for short openings will be Morph to Axe and AED (both can also be performed after blocking attacks). When you have a long opening, the main high damage combo you want to use is Rising Slash + Element Discharge II loop:

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">

</div>
</div></div>

ED2 can combo into AED by repeating the same button input as ED2. If you are comboing a monster that is down, you also want to finish with AED as it is getting up but this requires planning out exactly how many ED2s you want to do before you begin comboing. Some sample combos for different length openings can be found in section 3 <a href="/savage-axe-style-vs-saed-style/"> here</a>.

Warning! Rising Slash will launch teammates into the air, even if they have Flinch Free. If you want to avoid this, you can use Axe: Smash or Slinger Burst instead of Rising Slash. These are both lower DPS than Rising Slash so they're specifically only for avoiding launching teammates.

The forward and back sliding slashes are always a fixed distance in a straight line, but the left and right sliding slashes can be influenced by holding left/right during the slide, allowing you to turn almost 180 degrees (if you hold right on a left sliding slash or vice versa).

In general the forward, left, and right Sliding Slashes are rarely used as they are quite slow and as mentioned you are vulnerable while sliding. Backwards Sliding Slash can be used to move backward before using AED/SAED when you are too close to the target.

Honestly, sliding is kind of a pain in the ass for CB since it triggers accidentally a lot and doesn't lead into strong options. Your best bet if you do a sliding attack is to either stop by pressing back or jump and do an aerial attack (see above section).

<h4><a href="#section2-1" id="section2-1" class="offset-id">2.1</a> • Phial Type <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

For the first time we are stepping back from moveset and talking about properties of the weapon. In this case, it's the phial type which is tied to each different Charge Blade. To start, I will recap <b>phial explosion damage</b>:

<div class="pfix">
<ul>
<li>Certain Charge Blade actions (mostly Axe attacks) trigger one or more phial explosions</li>
<li>Phial explosions do not consume sharpess and never crit</li>
<li>Phial explosion strength varies depending on the attack used to trigger them</li>
<li>Phial explosions contribute to breaking monster parts but not severing tails</li>
<li>Phial explosion damage is increased by having your shield charged</li>
</ul>
</div>

The remaining properties of phial explosions depend on the phial type of the equipped weapon. There are two types: <b>Impact Phial</b> and <b>Power Element Phial</b>, which you can think of as non-elemental and elemental.

<div class="pfix">
Impact Phial effects:
<li>Deals damage that is independent of monster part toughness</li>
<li>Can KO monsters if impact phial explosions damage the monsters' head</li>
<li>SAED creates phial explosions in a straight line</li>
<li>Damage is boosted by Artillery, Felyne Bombardier (canteen skill), and increasing your Attack value</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="pfix">
Power Element Phial effects:
<ul>
<li>Deals elemental damage which depends on how weak the monster's part is to that element</li>
<li>Cannot KO monsters</li>
<li>SAED creates phial explosions in a wide V shape</li>
<li>Damage is boosted by increasing your element attack value, and hitting monster parts weak to that element</li>
</ul>
</div>

Impact Phial CBs can be used against any monster, but Power Element Phial CBs should only be used against monsters weak to the element on the CB. When matching weaknesses, elemental CBs generally outdamage impact phial CBs, but this comes at the cost of not being able to KO monsters and having to make multiple elemental CB sets for different monsters.

There is no easy answer to the question of which phial type is better against a particular monster as it depends on exactly how weak it is to an element on each part of its body and how easy those parts are to hit. For example, Nergigante is listed as 3 star weak to Thunder ingame, but in reality it is only weak on glossy black spikes which are temporary so Thunder elemental phials aren't worth using. When in doubt, use Impact Phials or look up a speedrun of the monster with CB and see what the speedrunner used.

<div class="pfix">
Now to list the CB actions that trigger phial explosions:
<ul>
<li>Shield Thrust (with shield charged): 1 very weak explosion</li>
<li>All other Sword mode attacks (with sword charged): 1 very weak explosion</li>
<li>Guard Point (with shield charged): 1 weak explosion</li>
<li>Axe Element Discharge 1: 1 weak explosion, consumes 1 phial</li>
<li>Axe Element Discharge 2: 2 weak explosions, consumes 1 phial</li>
<li>Axe Amped Element Discharge: 3 strong* explosions, consumes 1 phial</li>
<li>Axe Super Amped Element Discharge: N very strong explosions, consumes all N phials</li>
</ul>
</div>

*AED phial explosions are much stronger with elemental phials compared to impact phials

<h4><a href="#section2-2" id="section2-2" class="offset-id">2.2</a> • Block Strength <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

TL;DR Equip 1 level of Guard skill, always keep your shield charged, and always block using guard points. If you find that you still receive large knockback, upgrade to Guard 3, then Guard 5 if necessary.

This is a complicated topic to explain (which is why I have provided a TLDR), but it is also one that is important to understand. This is because of the fact that if you take too much knockback after blocking/GPing, you can't counter or take any action afterward.

<div class="pfix">
There are three levels of "block recoil" you can receive after blocking an attack: small, medium, and large:
<ul>
<li>Small knockback: consumes 1 sharpness, can counter</li>
<li>Medium knockback: consumes 2 sharpness (1 if GP), can counter</li>
<li>Large knockback: consumes 10 sharpness (5 if GP), <b>cannot counter</b></li>
</ul>
</div>

Due to the sharpness cost of large knockback and not being able to counter, you want to prevent taking large knockback. But sometimes the attacks that deal large knockback are the ones with openings that you want to block and counter. To make this possible, you can increase your block strength to turn that large knockback into medium or small knockback.

<div class="pfix">
The following increase your block strength:
<ul>
<li>Having charged shield</li>
<li>Blocking with a guard point instead of holding block</li>
<li>Equipping Guard skill (level 1 to 5)</li>
</ul>
</div>

It's a common misconception that you only ever need level 1 Guard because "adding charged shield and guard point gives you Guard 5 which is the cap". This is false. Even at Guard 5, charged shield and guard points still increase your block strength and there are monster attacks which are large knockback at Guard 5 but medium knockback at Guard 5 + guard point.

It's easy to explain how the 3 block strength factors add up by pretending that charged shield and guard points are equal to 2 levels of Guard, and that Guard can be "overcapped" by shield charge and guard point. See below examples:

Guard 1 + charged shield = Total Guard 3
Guard 1 + charged shield + GP = Total Guard 5
Guard 3 + charged shield + GP = Total Guard 7
Guard 5 + charged shield + GP = Total Guard 9

Also, only odd numbers of Guard matter. Or to put it another way, the breakpoints of "total guard" are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So you should only ever use Guard skill 0, 1, 3, or 5.

Guard 0 + charged shield = Guard 2 = Total Guard 1
Guard 0 + charged shield + GP = Guard 4 = Total Guard 3

In practice I recommend always using at least 1 level of Guard. Some monsters need Guard 3 and some need Guard 5. I don't have a complete list of these but Guard 1 is enough for ~80% of monsters assuming you are guard pointing. There are only a handful of monsters with attacks that require Guard 5 even when you are guard pointing:

<div class="pfix">
Monsters that need Guard 5 (non-exhaustive):
<ul>
<li>Raging Brachydios</li>
<li>Zinogre (back slam)</li>
<li>Stygian Zinogre (back slam)</li>
<li>Namielle</li>
<li>Ruiner Nergigante</li>
<li>Rajang (laser, also needs Guard Up)</li>
<li>Furious Rajang (laser, also needs Guard Up)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<details>
<summary>Show technical explanation for nerds</summary>
<div class="details-inside">
Read this for how the game actually calculates knockback received. Every monster attack has an associated damage value and knockback value. The knockback value is a whole number, with most knockback values falling between 10 and 100. This knockback value interacts with the "guard thresholds" of the weapon used to block the attack. The Guard Thresholds for Charge Blade are 14 and 39. This means any attack with knockback value of 14 or less is small knockback when blocked using Charge Blade, anything from 15 to 39 is medium knockback, and anything 40 or higher is large knockback.

<div class="pfix">
Guard Threshold modifiers for Charge Blade
<ul>
<li>Charged shield: +10</li>
<li>Guard point: +10</li>
<li>Guard skill: +10/10/20/20/30 for level 1/2/3/4/5</li>
</ul>
</div>

So if I had charged shield, was guard pointing, and had Guard 3, the thresholds would be 54 and 79 (14+40 and 39+40). So anything up to 54 would be small knockback, 55 to 79 would be medium knockback, and 80+ would be large knockback. So it mostly true that charged shield and guard point are equal to 2 levels of Guard, the only difference is Guard has a secondary effect of also reducing stamina cost of blocking.

The above information is in the General Data Sheet in the appendix. Kiranico has information for monsters' attack knockback values (<a href="#sectionA-3">[A.3]</a>).

<h4><a href="#section2-3" id="section2-3" class="offset-id">2.3</a> • Focus <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Focus is a skill that doesn't directly increase any offensive or defense properties, but can significantly alter CB gameplay.

<div class="pfix">
Focus effects:
<ul>
<li>Increase phial charge gain for all sword attacks by 5/10/20%</li>
<li>Decrease button hold time necessary to use Double Slash and Condensed Element Slash (sword charge) by 5/10/20%</li>
</ul>
</div>

The first effect is the main reason to take Focus, as you can spend significantly less time charging phials and more time slinging SAEDs or comboing with Power Axe mode.

Focus 3 and Focus 0 are both viable as Focus 3 is a significant investment for this indirect damage uptime increase and you might want to opt for direct damage increases instead of Focus. <b>I would generally recommmend to always use Focus 3 unless you are very experienced with CB</b>. Focus 1 and 2 are not used because (by coincidence) the Sword mode combos for getting yellow/red phials don't change unless you have Focus 3.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section2-3-1" id="section2-3-1" class="offset-id">2.3.1</a> • Sword mode combos for charging phials <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

This section had to wait for the the explanation of Focus, which is why it's all the way here. These combos are the fastest ways to get to yellow/red phial outlines starting from 0 phial buildup.

</div></div>

As you can see, Focus 3 is significant in that it saves one attack for yellow phials and only needs one charged slash instead of two for red phials. Focus 3 also allows for smooth combos that charge both shield and full phials. The below combo simply performs the standard red phials combo for Focus 3 twice, first with Weak Slash + Charged Double Slash + Spinning Slash, reloading, then doing Return Stroke + Charged Double Slash + Elemental Roundslash. You can even charge the sword too since the last action is a reload.

<h1><a href="#section3-0" id="section3-0" class="offset-id">3.0</a> • Advanced Topics <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h1>

If you are very dedicated to Charge Blade and want to reach the realm of clearing quests in 5 minutes or less, this section may help you by explaining some techniques that strong players and speedrunners naturally use but may escape the eye of newer players even when watching speedruns. Many of these seem obvious when you read them (especially the first 3) but it takes a lot of time to incorporate them into your gameplay. Most of these techniques are applicable to all weapons.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section3-1" id="section3-1" class="offset-id">3.1</a> • Focusing weak points <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Now this one may seem really obvious but it does take a while (as a new player) to adjust to the mindset that it's not enough to hit the monster, you have to be hitting it in the right place. SAED may deal 1000 damage with phials, but the physical hits can easily deal another 1000 damage if you are landing them on a weak point. Striking Velkhana's head deals anywhere from 30-100% more damage than hitting its other parts, and this discrepancy grows more if its head is tenderized. Hopefully I got the point across here.

As for the question of which part of each monster is weakest, usually you can't go too wrong going for the head (especially with Impact Phials which can KO). Most monsters can also be toppled or "tripped" just by dealing enough damage to a specific part. This is usually the head for elder dragons and the legs for other monsters, but there are several exceptions. When in doubt, look up a speedrun of the monster and see what the runner focuses on.

Last piece of advice is focusing tail is usually a waste of time when a monster is not immobilized. Monsters generally turn to face you so you end up chasing a target that is always moving away from you. Also, tails are thin and usually constantly moving hitboxes.. don't be so tempted by the tail carve that you deal no damage during the hunt.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section3-2" id="section3-2" class="offset-id">3.2</a> • Angling attacks <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

In Monster Hunter, you can slightly change the facing direction of your character before every attack to adjust the direction you are attacking. This is done by having left/right held (relative to your current facing direction) during the beginning moments of the attack.

For Charge Blade, this is most relevant for AED and SAED because of their long, thin hitboxes. It is often necessary to angle left or right during the windup of these attacks to hit the target you want to hit (monster's head, tail etc).

There is one peculiarity to mention which is that AED and SAED both have 2 periods where angle can be changed instead of 1 like most attacks. The first is during the initial input of SAED after Shield Thrust, and the second is either after cancelling into AED or after the player can no longer cancel into AED. This is confusing but the angling periods will be highlighted in the videos below.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">
[video width="720" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stripedypaper/stripedypaper.github.io/master/media/2020/3-2 angling_small.mp4"]
<div class="guide-video-caption">
    <span>Angling attacks</span>
</div>
</div></div>

AED is difficult to angle when your shield is charged because your left/right input must immediately follow the backwards input to cancel SAED into AED. This is a skill worth mastering as being able to angle ~30 degrees to either side can greatly increase your ability to land AEDs.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section3-3" id="section3-3" class="offset-id">3.3</a> • Delaying attacks <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

After attacking, you have a window of time to input a linked attack/action before your character resets to neutral standing position. Usually, you want to link attacks in a combo as quickly as possible, but it can sometimes be useful to delay combo inputs. For example, the input for AED/SAED after Shield Thrust can be delayed substantially. The same can be done after a medium knockback after blocking an attack. You can watch a monster's behavior during this delay before committing to AED/SAED or decide not to commit.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">

<h4><a href="#section3-4" id="section3-4" class="offset-id">3.4</a> • Pivot attacks <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

I'm not sure if there is a more widely accepted name for this technique. When your character returns to a neutral standing position after performing an action, holding a direction will cause you to turn sharply ("pivot") before beginning to walk in that direction. If you input an attack during this pivot, your character will start to attack but at the same time the pivot will not be interrupted and you will continue to (while attacking) turn to the direction you would have begun walking. This technique is useful for minimizing the time needed to turn 180 and block/attack.

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">
[video width="720" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stripedypaper/stripedypaper.github.io/master/media/2020/3-4 pivot_small.mp4"]
<div class="guide-video-caption">
    <span>Pivot attacks</span>
</div>
</div></div>

This is difficult to master as you cannot input the pivot attack too early. For example, in the above example of side hop + pivot charged slash, inputting the turn + charged slash too early (before your character returns to neutral) would result in a sliding slash. You basically have to memorize the timing for when your character returns to neutral after an action.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<h4><a href="#section3-5" id="section3-5" class="offset-id">3.5</a> • Sword only playstyle <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

Also called "overcharge" or "overheat" sword playstyle.

In many action and fighting games, attacks have what is called "hitlag": your character freezes for a moment when landing a hit to emphasize the impact of the strike. Unlike fighting games where both the attacker and target freeze during hitlag, in Monster Hunter only the player freezes, meaning in some sense it is purely detrimental to experience hitlag as it slows your attack down and increases the time you are vulnerable. However, several properties of the game coincide to allow Charge Blade to ignore hitlag on Sword attacks.

<div class="pfix">
<ul>
<li>attacks that bounce off the target have no hitlag (this is normally reserved for extremely tough monster parts)</li>
<li>attack bouncing can be prevented using Mind's Eye skill</li>
<li>Charge Blade can force Sword attacks to bounce by building too much phial energy without reloading</li>
<li>Charge Blade can give itself Mind's Eye by charging the sword</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="guide-video-outer"><div class="guide-video-inner">
[video width="720" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stripedypaper/stripedypaper.github.io/master/media/2020/3-5 overcharge sword_small.mp4"]
<div class="guide-video-caption">
    <span>Zero hitlag sword</span>
    <span>Overheat your sword and attack while you have Mind's Eye</span>
</div>
</div></div>

By overcharging the sword and giving yourself Mind's Eye (either through the armor skill or by charging sword), all Sword attacks will have no hitlag, greatly increasing your attack speed. This is most effective with Power Element Phial CBs as elemental damage for attacks is calculated as a flat amount added to each attack, which benefits spamming fast and weak attacks. For the same reason, charged sword will add a ton of damage from the phial explosions with every sword hit, but it only lasts a short time and you must reload (losing overcharge state) to charge the sword again.

To be clear, this is not an optimal playstyle (to my knowledge) but it is fun to build for and play.

    <span>Dodging Roars</span>
</div>
</div></div>

Dodging through roars is one of the most difficult skills to learn, but the knowledge is useful and transferable to every weapon. While Charge Blade often should block roars instead of evading (since you can counter after blocking them), occasionally you will want to evade them instead. For example, when you are unable to block such as when you are in Axe mode or after reloading (which is one of the few Sword actions that does not link into Morph to Axe GP).

Unfortunately, there aren't any shortcuts to learning to dodge roars except by trying and failing until you get the timing, and every monster has a different roar (though monsters sharing the same skeleton often have the same timing). Evade Window will make it easier but it's not worth using decoration slots for.

<h4><a href="#section3-6-2" id="section3-6-2" class="offset-id">3.6.2</a> • Optimal item usage <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

This is just a quick PSA that you can walk quickly while using items using the sprint button (consumes stamina). Also, the ending lag of consumable items (i.e when your character wipes their mouth after drinking a potion) can be cancelled by evading or attacking.

Also, don't forget you can bring 7 (seven) Max Potions to each quest. This is done by bringing the max of 2 Max Potions, plus ingredients to craft 5 more (5 Mandragora and 5 Mega Nutrient). Setting Max Potion to your radial menu will autocraft Max Pots once you have run out of the initial 2. I recommend setting up your botany farm for Mandragora, Blue Mushroom, Bitterbug, and Honey which is all the ingredients required for Max Potions.

<h4><a href="#section3-6-3" id="section3-6-3" class="offset-id">3.6.3</a> • Side hop from neutral <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h4>

This is a situational technique that allows you to side hop quickly from a standing position in Sword mode without attacking first. If you specifically want to move to the side and stay facing the same direction, this is faster than walking or rolling and turning.

The walking sheath animation can be interrupted by walking off a small ledge (doesn't work with tall ledges). This will immediately sheath your weapon as you go midair. Works with all weapons.

<h1><a href="#section4-0" id="section4-0" class="offset-id">4.0</a> • Conclusion <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">to top</a></h1>

Congratulations if you have made it here! You've finished reading this guide, but reading can only get you so far. Here are the next steps for you to continue improving at CB:

<ol>
<li>Get into the game and hunt monsters with CB until you have memorized the controls</li>
<li>Condition yourself to use guard points instead of blocking, then hunt more monsters until you are comfortable guard pointing at all times</li>
<li>Optimize your armor and decorations! You're already at the right website for that</li>
<li>If you reach a wall at a certain monster, look up quest speedruns on Youtube for Charge Blade vs. that monster</li>
</ol>
